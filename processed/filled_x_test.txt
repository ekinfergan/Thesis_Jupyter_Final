interesting fascinating topic
am bit disappointed by fast paced information regarding videos there lot time spent details reading out source code. exercises quite basic they did real challenges - errors coming from or mistakes Also think level support provided by mentors quite providing any help forums so students kind one another - sometimes proper class also requires level all think an mostly It needs some serious work make great
It understand how brain totally recommend
This my feedback as thought videos were clear, well organized well from topic topic. There clear as professor various missing me some quizzes. Not me what just rather ones make So, example, final video Week optional instead just students think would better give them an actual or about What Y liked he what numbers needed changed make share But rather than just us would another opportunity students video go try With specific students will go work This where real learning takes things really liked about design prior courses by Professor fact he had examples throughout videos had apply information right perhaps just me. know learn lot better by doing rather than just watching videos going makes also some students, past courses, probably said they find quizzes value quizzes as whole or just quizzes simply require something said sure professor can come up lots examples. In Week 1 1 quiz might provide some numbers results each And maybe about what type question which an answer provided he could students change some specific things what has 1 2 offers lots similar students work from specific would perhaps question For example, what would if introduced Just something people videos offer similar think having specific problems or questions will learning experience rather than just they look at these courses quite bit different from your university student probably needs bit order if Professor students will watch optional videos why make them In case despite some mathematics being little some students, think information there really useful helps an understanding if an question would helpful. might provide new set ask what means terms their or something Just some practice questions get people working apply weeks. think would help students some quizzes only up videos helps keep students focused also provides key really liked quiz Week 1 even though questions where there multiple correct quiz information covered well requires one think about what covered may want students questions may change from quiz In many these courses, quiz questions do change students may questions they correct previous 2 After at talking about an means future A bit explanation around what means would 3 no particular additional lectures other than some questions might found really It would really nice something up lectures some quiz questions might help. This would also help reinforce 4 quiz question correct may cause students particularly those English their native enjoyed learned lot. whether would possible provide all key information from each week related key things look related those know provided might written some information about how use think quizzes or practice questions would helpful students perhaps ones asked students do specific things come back an They need long or complicated just something gets people into working them You may want do something them Many will feel change numbers up. they can change they want because if they something up they can always again. they can also might idea where there simple set students can try changing things financial see key without having move from one another first two You might even want two one numbers does change one changed so students can see changes terms thought were fairly straight forward relatively easy understand. That may case people less familiar know what so students may all On if numbers should some way they That clear first lot mistakes out many these by specific videos where they opportunity hope my helpful missed too much students issues as goes
Another great from University
overall, problem much even after completing still sure how got some way solve it, no idea why way.

helpful. It has many am sure will helpful. just wish some classroom management strategies could
Overall pretty good, think maybe week or so really take time look at tasks run angular content pretty helpful, though.
Even though there lot useful information course, personally like it. take again if had chance go back much about Java than algorithms. any discussion will find out questions problems about algorithms. If professional will spend at least hours instead just explanation about most difficult structure single After must write by Just look at week 5 discussion know why there topics week 3 only week people do teacher must make students love it. sure about as
Very introduction. animations videos could learning too complex tasks different sections together.

Very useful introduction android
Great class learn Great learning how use two different platforms applying real world applications
This took me three several hours work week While definitely learned lot during would been really helpful instructor feedback may possible when an which when my work took also think many problem could been clearly For example, spent lot time problem graphs allowed multiple between two when out order pass did need implement being I've learned lot from courses specialization, thanks work put into it!
great. informative there lot best practices i can practice my day day only area i see quiz week 2. found difficult pass choices
material good, did couple lectures questions presented out What really me however were quizzes. In weekly quizzes first answer always right In final quiz most questions had first answer as right Since answers so am really at why quizzes would presented way.
core concepts well explained
It's great introductory found platform completing assignments, easy use. so informative
well introduces courses.
It's best course, which ever been Its language understandable only students who interested topic. professor professional his just person an skills. He into an interesting because every module some attention makes teaching material If will definitely join it! Thank
Interesting instructors. were sometimes bit too much about too little about applying knowledge practical way intro But next job life fun You won't it.
Great Course
loved It fit material made seem like college setting than watching lectures class all time.
love explanation. would highly appreciated if some practice material provided which would by after

what looking
lectures exercises awesome. can believe can solve hard problems by Now I'm confident talk about algorithms. Thanks
Enjoyed It really my skills
Very enjoyable. Highly recommended.
A changed my life my
best fundamental data structure algorithms ever
So far professor most engaging math professor ever Very easy follow examples.
Good as there only few people so hard their hope there will some intermediate or advanced courses.
Best Thanks Coursera & Duke University
Interesting
Great! next one
Great course, It gave me an overview problems.
worth time, thanks professor
loved teacher.
This it's compared other courses specialization. my interesting say out other course, if aren't other course, don't access those lot thought went into All them this. some no about problem can same like other courses specialization my much 4 algorithms no discussion when use each so on. Also, no passing all test cases we should able solution correct order improve our
lectures! better than challenging assignments.
my mind after watching nutrition just teacher has idea about what really present her watching course, part fairly if continue at least make sure keep other points view as
enthusiastic about teaching which helpful when learning.
really like subject presentation really good. However, some concepts were so easy understand. does provide any so had watch lectures again if some I've started taking detailed notes my wish could exercises just practice would That would provide learn practice before taking final Some answers exercises were helpful learn concepts better. So, such practical exercises would helpful.
too many concepts relevant challenges my wish would actually show me how solve business part enjoyable at all.
An excellent course! interested development cancer should take lectures well presented structured, so they quite easy follow even found part cancer particularly interesting - would go into detail here would my wish future courses.
Very interesting basic algorithms learned here useful. For development big data analysis.
This another providing slightly deeper than had seen other courses. big me, addition algorithm path some between also like approach data structures then down into detail level find hard say understand data structure based would felt at least makes me at at am about into next As two courses am new about kind programming issues I've been solving than
some difficult, it's so useful

Interesting
found there were some technical could out text final assignment if when addition content bit It 3 weeks finish 2 about quality
like course, covers wide range topics.
With title found gained little additional insight form
he really can explain simple
This nice providing such great content from University allow us complete as wait till week 2
has given me insight into programming parts
never knew excel had so much
Very introduction. Well paced
It an introduction some really beautiful look under helps appreciate them even those well don't much formal feel learned something from course, enjoyed
Great beginner Arduino. experienced programming will probably end up through some videos pretty fast or some them because programming found lessons interesting would recommend them anyone new Arduino or wanting refresher
Excellent material. learn about series its importance
Really Great fantastic also theory
Exceptional knowledge programming experience Java highly recommended.
Excellent enjoyed learning about healthy eating children how them process class got me practice these great habits my family. :)
Jim awesome!
Great explanations complex material.
This has amazing information lectures, difficult video lectures out what information going relevant will quizzes number no matter how well taking Also last section made quiz based maths lesson would highly recommend anyone who already knows basic anyone who

Exceptional If children - Well done.
Very course,
Very informative Loved all tried most them.
lessons contain brief explanation even if an introduction study There lot key things terms remember mostly hard if do which also believe necessary further like side Prof.
Really great introductory am real beginner since need make easier my self at data learning gives me solid basic understanding between Week 3 4 pretty hard my after doing learning how learn know how it, so will recommend do one also if think too difficult you.
lectures, his explain concepts simple way, makes we can continue through Calculus 3
This one my courses I've even taken Coursera. instructor at explaining subject beginner like me who has some programming experience yet Arduino.
This an excellent introductory field
nice one get into any kind could pass even if didn't go through will then useful understand basis
best maths class
gives basic overview software needed if going full will

A It does teach everything about C programming does job teaching required understand implement simple C Arduino well explained.
least were basic weeks into parts stats don't from my college so took some extra work apply
This enlightening than previous courses specialization. It felt like learning new material techniques rather than simply concepts already also liked assignments required creating actual work. interviews were nice addition as well.
I'm so glad University working Coursera. great course!

think interesting well structured
Very educational course, however lectures do attention well.
believe teacher great way explaining what seems complicated thought he does so highly enthusiastic only such explanations can either too low level or strong enough explain certain For example, professor about how value at how at certain point when by at same given point. However, professor never truly explains why how our However, experience.

This one best courses I've taken so far. It's great see how easy build simple yet computer your has given me first time feeling really understanding what's going at low complete about project building so there no quizzes only few theoretical background lectures here. If want hands-on introduction computer way
an excellent useful easily strongly recommend it.
It's interesting useful It my reading skills. Thank much!
Very practical approach teach AngularJS
While first week Excel can used Excel data, feels as if math than And my what thought up for. So, felt like me.
Great Course!
really my writing. due fact there were no practical exercises Though some theoretical stuff covered sort common most still so don't taking
beginning bit only end some practical examples up. bit old presenters bit
It's helpful you.
information sharing as an at issue
Amazing Calculus course, helped me lot.
Fantastic found challenging enough keep me so difficult got or However, lot material found concepts already familiar having worked IT A true beginner would most find some concepts difficult start - keep at it!
one best courses materials regarding algorithms i worth my time money
believe Even I'm am software can understand how how them.

Very useful programming.
Very fine explanation
poor never give any No where problem come forum only help few No general ideas how solve lot time still couldn't pass waste my time
Perfect introduction Big Data
thorough i loved if had way instructors better out rather than things chance everyone But either way experience Would recommend anyone
read some other feel should some their material, there things unclear difficult will need read around subjects introduced from other sources how will learn far yet complete course, am about start my get little further each time next presentation as introduces key concepts need better perhaps maybe should statistical concepts data science using
This one best ones I've ever taken Coursera.
Good ... alot worth it.

This essential analysis data using Excel
<empty>
Even though covers lot fundamentals introduction itself designed as as expected. For weekly problem aren't good. Some problem clear read than one time or take look at examples. designed take Some problem even has than one possible correct which just confusing learning terms lecture videos, it's there some algorithm problems being however between how problem mathematical poorly explained. For example, lecture well explained at all. personally appreciate lot thorough steps introduced lectures, however personally think often well explained (I also understand it's difficult explain variety would recommend instructors comprehensive in-depth knowledge into optional videos, way could if they want spend time optional videos or based their own instructors could spend little bit time explain difficult concepts better. Overall, know talking algorithms can boring challenging, wish videos could interesting way.
learned new concepts use only my life. would suggest material presented.
Great course!! it's
