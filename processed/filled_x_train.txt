I've learn thank Coursera :) :) :)
Fantastic complex concepts using simple examples
Excellent source information.
Ancient brief overview from about starting Prof. great knowledge about covering has two professor through lectures, his being overview so there isn't great study any single is, however, solid also felt done about no coverage feels on.

This most challenging one among all courses specialization. wish there were how we get from like so also had watch bayesian understand material second Prof. enough Prof. has an amazing teaching understand she tried present complicated material simple way, as already mentioned wish there were examples behind these like thanks such an amazing experience.
This wonderful
It informative. basic nutrition cooking class, loved video different It gave me some great ideas try my own family.
love practice
If could give less than 1 It wasn't an Excel class, rather business statistics class only lectures no benefit textbook actually help learn. Lots errors lectures little no support from You won't it.
took refresh my Data Algorithms knowledge order prepare technical I'm glad lectures great programming assignments well designed You really work them. would liked graded after lectures. This also first MOOC I've gives me great sense
Excellent overview practice new live
Thank so much!
Good Very well organized
really enjoy how in-depth lessons four small children learned they what we do because they love us as their role models if we would want our why should our children. This world so fast paced fast food yet we can still make even small choices healthy us like maybe or if we absolutely something while out. it's much better cook at home family time
really little bit familiar statistics after everything clear my mind any also .
Fantastic review brain Thank you.
Great introduction Accounting Could analytics or additional or optional problem sets explore
It challenging. It would better if couple practice exercises were put after relevant lecture videos just after weekly lecture videos.
bit too many errors there's no proper introduction new
There has been few It's still at an introductory level. At some points goes example rest stay at high level. an excel can ...
This my first algorithm loved it! challenging just easy enough me get through an
thank great
Also many resources made available further learning.
concept poor
content if good, lecturers better read slides read any book watching their videos time.
This just needs details lectures explain some difficult points simple way. And could much comprehensive help students understand each theory. Although could require weeks up weeks worth doing as taken by students research hope we can see some
information about new treatment strategies data. Easy understand
Great easy explained Loved cooking some Also great no children since there basic food facts everyone should know fun informative time needed follow up enough even
Excellent statistical analysis little too fast towards end overall learned lot.
A bit - like it!
Very helpful
Good place start if don't know anything about 3D printing.
Dr professor. has application along assignments well learning content. Highly recommend class.
An excellent those interested an introduction classical studied history at high learn about ancient This provided me great introduction. And my interest reading ancient That point no need liked read ancient
This so good, all concepts also Arduino.
I'm so glad I've taken This really
Not only contents also how presented. Jim presents content so much A nice example how teaching mathematics or any at any educational should done.
We learn lot
Amazing Course , everything an level financial looking
Perfect comprehensive much.
Loved am A truly perspective universe
Excellent will follow also some others or all next courses specialization.
highly recommend entire It's clearly taught requires your practical application I've learned great deal thoroughly enjoyed process. Many many thanks

This full fun
excellent program starting world It great pleasure experience must do
really enjoyed Prof Dr. their
Nice course, great teacher, english simple understand, great novice those who want bring Arduino. suggest it! Only one take certificate

Instructor
presented Very informative. Some really recommended links read along side Well thought out.
Good course!!!
This interesting, enlightening wonderful introduction especially learners no prior experience 3D printing.
its really
My least part course, still put together well. Content just isn't as interesting as rest specialization. bit too instead
Very interesting
Excellent course! Highly recommended
took because first liked idea history lesson whole universe. Maybe also explain everything just one second as out they don't any what second They always second part just think will example isn't beginning they tell should about everything new hear or get taught. But if question things they teach they will you. One at discussion forum they fast feedback by students, questions scientific who show different get weeks They They just see what their view their opinion everything their course, believe In they so That same how their changing world such seems one. But also here they talk about change they by In my opinion an important discussion if such way. For sure helpful! But doesn't fit their world they get away by by This isn't just lack understanding or or flow just history course, no knowledge biology or even if take course, their
material interesting videos. Great get an introduction me some videos were as they had too much content, quizzes could much found questions really content.
am love Highly recommend it. Even if don't complete extremely useful all medical professionals anyone who wants know statistics.
It's amazing , gained knowledge about What Big its sources much more.
Very interesting which makes thinking while reading listening looking at things from another open world your own mind different way.
A lot stuff basic common knowledge among my own social reason kept watching because exceptional explain complex topics simple way. As teacher trying introduce my own students instructor's style has given me so many ideas how these concepts my own so much your hard work! will take your other class hope see others from something about or food access areas long child development those
One best courses statistics beginners. concepts well explained, learning path well everything R labs were beginners.
lecture assignments challenging No slides provided. Professor an bad need keep going back videos when doing For me, shows lack Some excel provided. But they videos. instructions No instructions provided never used so had hard Very few examples real examples You learn math concepts, Excel which it's NOT videos. had learn They say complete each final after finish week related But they only say as start week doesn't provide material final assignment. You get without knowing how get Some answers final assignment check answer results aren't present never recommend only took because I'm finish taken several most one by
gets week after week, understandable week about dynamic programming. when gave up write review just one assignment missing complete teachers native english which their english hard understand. found myself having watch some videos over over again order understand what being tried reading even It seems they were from videos, thus poor teachers use mathematical feels they do mention as part necessary background. However, even though an online course, they use any teaching method some dry mathematical someone speaking about content. only resources offered help learning few open source expected much only aspect from assignment which allow write your multiple deeply money time spent
Excelent an teacher.
super useful best ever
As college management information wasn't taught most these important business metrics context even only taught dynamic metrics would highly recommend those who looking understand different check
Very nicely organized
pace material. really helps lot terms stats calculus courses.
Simply did only helped me develop required skills, gave me try totally recommended specialization
would recommend few There no notes video lectures. lectures text available really figure why instructor provide an what key concepts he wants us learn from each lecture. Also, Coursera doesn't require basic set learning tools paid class, such as lecture notes or an This might class if learn well from quizzes contain written questions no weeks there little For example, week 2 few videos professor students from Duke program. They seemed like nice people content videos offered little value nothing someone already working
Very interesting so questions sometimes than practical exercises.
It would beneficial if maybe one or two videos were in-depth into their method analysis. from class educational interesting as expected.
haven't finished all material fantastic refresher single learn couple things missed high school.
loved because learned Thank you!
Very overview business
His enthusiasm really explanations clear easy understand. It would nice
Excellent course; English little difficult understand at times nothing too
Great introduction Big data :)
think about time algorithms some applications different algorithms. spent time then though
Course did any Excel analysis part. focused one aspects make In my opinion & too much statistics model building regression did do
knowledge improve
am still can't my English , so just say thank you.
content just teachers so awesome me do courses from
It's useful learn how excel able different mathematical models
This any other planning effective real your no matter which subject or material trying highly recommend it.
Very good, well Enjoyed every lesson an excellent overview what computer 5

loved It made me how small we yet how It helped me understand various aspects universe also about so much
Awesome - one my I've done Coursera. It's thorough yet clear. also like can pass just by algorithms as shown lectures, then each assignment has multiple additional problems which challenge think Really great
It's fairly things know

This up your really try understand how things work. learned lot hard effort much better than things learned without much highly recommend am grateful took kind person who everything enjoy However, if enjoy solving often or poorly presented information then can improved concrete example real numbers show how some graphs show how functions practice problems clear explanations case get exercises sections being presented example, asked question which series which presented till last worked out examples detailed using confusing learned lot best lesson when professor Jim Fowler point mathematics Not whether something true

Too simple lack practice
My specialization still because questions had wrong answers module quizzes taking complete quizzes because had which one wrong answers would correct time. questions through slightly different questions each so can't simply use each 100% thought maybe would better same problems here. I've over 6 hours trying pass these tests I'm completely over it. also out they went through said they couldn't find anything wrong couldn't help me impossible because it's past Even though paid 2 time courses. Also, math videos all over place an issue someone even looking at video before would taken less than 5 entire Also, every time question nothing In every single all I've used Coursera few other courses thought they were makes me think otherwise feel like such an paying people forums shown they same problem over ago someone from Coursera get me help me
Good however test difficult questions since open different points or so hard get right
Very course, much learn. By applying step by step every aspect me helpful. hope courses follow
Good course!

It great. loved fact could watch videos follow steps at my own content really clear were both subject presented open other recommend everyone interested
were clear, most were fun Material dynamic programming might been Also, notes would been helpful. Thanks putting together great
Really learning well explained
Nice data as well as various data management data
Week 3 difficult
Excellent teaching !
gives an overview topic. particularly appreciated hands all students hands create some personal notes code quickly review those particular learning used at work both directly within both cases going deep understanding data model behind concepts like You can like current where system needs understanding model behind simply much easy than expected.

Excellent Awesome
It doesn't explain every thing
But Great And :)
covered slightly harder than previous courses specialization. found myself having keep going back through lessons an understand. You really do need read up other sources some overall covers lot.
did their homework putting well done.

Great course, great content Great teachers
course, until now.
This project huge me. would where we would use build high quality Also apply your skills create app also read we would allowed build an app our choice or That text now seems been these were we got something like lectures whole four weeks, all simple framework face framework isn't so there's only so much can do it. Most us only some simple animations top face shown actually enough get full form used peer does even paid as much as previous There should similar amount lectures advanced topics like current best which other interesting things provide building art For real project, expect than 4 weeks would necessary order able build since many us doing our feel had up before hope will take our make out future students.
Perfect perfect professor.
Great course! fundamentals were covered am excited take next
found informative, quizzes problem as there were too many multiple so impossible complete quizzes
am say poor english too bad do teach could useful lots speaking students better quality

Overall, effective introduction AngularJS. AngularJS can or an videos exercises do great job get over learning This will give thorough foundation way better than any other free will give an idea where can go off explore your own if you're interested going develop intermediate only really had explore at end each section get grasp some concepts. found some videos pretty complicated subjects weren't thorough enough allow complete some exercises. also think introduces some pretty complicated tools too early new doesn't do job explaining their value still amazing free If you've done any quick AngularJS you've really only AngularJS. A hands-on like give much better To despite it's still best free introduction AngularJS online Good
simple three lessons about R been looking forward start next
like great Can't wait until start week 2. A bit myself quiz think one has really all off information get 100% one - anyone got finished week 2 am already giving five A top course, up all job. haven't found number He probably I'm looking it, he is, Can't say I'd do same if found out looking my

content must if missed stuff It teaches algorithmic analysis so know which algorithm gives some examples cool techniques provides challenges apply those there things about First all about forums. They down into there too little people each provides exactly help. If no hope these forums will need find help assignments great, they interesting, challenging system only if we get correct answer also our There been some problems section though. I've been search quite simple pass assignment weeks. I've written different done forums same again again. able solve only by am quite sure there test which cost me hours Overall, programming assignments time lack support test cases make things do like we cannot see test case where our program if could figure out test case might your program would make better felt like our time. main thing test case understand will bring same without time lecturers strong It lot work take some English before making course, isn't enrolled specialization full only start with. Now am glad did because now am sure about other courses will look done great which highly believe can make much better by issues

This -- both courses specialization -- like your mostly work them some then shown them what only got one day at work your so kind enough them explanation what can't really teach them much such short time. So, set them after now courses really who can spend much time than will see lots really cool things -- like etc. -- don't come into you'll really learn because just possible time This whole thing about deep learn This like going watch then having their put your correct then you. -- now can learning about if simply then addition then then finally then tell you, what should write order solve Would learned about solving At would written example solving certain kind doubt after being through one positive many different things world -- cannot However, could so much more. model having students watch video person talking about whether or text full from classroom experience higher It's we aren't different stuff after so it's still what people expect at least learned

Very Clear simple explanations mathematical
Although taken algorithm courses still learnt lot from
two years ago completed Dr. Analysis quite impressed by it. always follow up bayesian so really excited when topic had finally been However while Dr. does nice job explaining other teachers aren't as Most slides / videos quite teaching because they over important steps without giving explanations. Also quite disappointed pretty much only only over introduction than - instead simple example, into topic bayesian model Another point R - doesn't really teach bayesian stats It teaches how like or instead This totally wish would over prior methods then focus methods by teaching how build interesting useful models using For anyone interested bayesian stats I'd recommend reading Bayesian Data Analysis - Bayesian These actually than
Some contents just seem especially videos. If they would do few problems similar those would much better.
student teacher students figure things out without or explanation math concepts required fully understand lectures.
Too simple, no just theory.
best ever had opportunity

am really disappointed content If what you're looking most basic information making better choices your after maybe you. however, come wanting specific information about how build great meals or like know how their needs change over time, you. hoping information like how teach your difficult things whole wanted know at what wanted know how many should based how changes over time. wanted know tips getting right amount each into diet if extra should wanted tips if you're still just wanted addition, quizzes so easy as quiz question correct NOT way approach if healthy choices through need University tell me instructor someone knowledge, someone who wants gain deeper understanding. videos slow waiting could read entire worth under half rather than go through all videos. And don't think someone interested learning about child nutrition slow how make basic If basics then about different etc. how best make basic into complete would been useful just This best perhaps health someone college level information about topic their

It's Simply
teacher boring he all information clearly.
As taking class, often who Although class has no lot engineering being used without ever what I'm sure people would get much out lectures. On other lectures were mostly at so I'm sure technical people would get much out them only topic got deep wasn't clear Arduino don't need understand any or less than any other aspect how an Arduino were other we had into form all when had my program each time. most could follow assignment instructions after submitted might find out grading included other In one case people asked about it, out grading were they were never My sense much effort went into
quite disappointed First should know first week at all rest difficulty matter. As by first week presentation way explaining as started second week what clear, concise examples ideas presented first one. First presentation following weeks done by software give poor ! It really That could by explanations may say case most time. examples something numbers come up from ... level difficulty could challenging if like or or NOT A give context done courses , 2 about 3 others courses first time giving bad sure teachers put lot effort doing , there lot subjects presented definitely suggest change presentation start then fully explain examples. With some changes will high :)

nice basic overview easy use tips diet
finished part. In excellent Professor Fowler at explaining concepts both He provides both intuitive explanations. learned lot up many concepts. i really appreciated balance between visual real problem quiz It does correct answers even when those answers exactly same as ones provided by way your There something really wrong quiz review code. That can when little after some hard work - know your answers correct - In been correct same questions quizzes. So take - enjoy learning - don't because Coursera yet over perhaps someone will see make some professor clear main problem quizzes. On several submitted answers were completely only find them all graded know they were correct because had friends check them after They could understand why quizzes were way. On certain questions one quiz were graded correct - then same type question another quiz graded In some my answers were exactly same as those by way correct - yet there several ways an we no way knowing what form On out answers were required form - their But how we know will write at end It learning - don't get if get bad It probably an your work. A final point - Professor Fowler should learn It NOT It He is, after all, You would want speak would - class.
Great Course. wide knowledge about Angular

Very course, nice work!
Excellent content as an introduction Android programming. videos paced designed well.
This fantastic course, even if you've never before 3D printing or you've been using 3D I'd highly recommend anyone interested technology or videos engaging. There interviews people who involved 3D printing who specific topics 3D each offer their future 3D printing. All different perspectives really helped me understand importance 3D printing at both an level. an introductory course, it's information might take off Even though had 3D before took course, learned lot!

Nice introduction about arduino its
must say feel disappointed especially when whole Data Algorithms series take as point learn how between times than algorithms those used Google out least challenging only introduction big topic. preparing time too still miss teaching style assignment design first series though. It would seem pay following courses if among first ones who take got 100% grade each ever since
Very exercises hands do actually add much value
Great course!! If interested animal welfare particularly animal welfare animals lots resources.

Good first look at Big Data concepts.
Great course, great now must learning
later part practical find difficult relate
This overview Big data concept simple way. found useful. Instructors explain concepts. Though would add one or two or optional hands graph data
business background found challenging enough learned something didn't take me long master basics so could starting talking about what learned my friends almost did think about final assignment which great my learning. also enjoyed other assignments new insights case from my MOOC students.
Perfect

Jim Fowler has ability complex concepts, make them easier really made interesting. I'm glad took - my also shows me learning really fun.
Excellent lectures by Prof. were clear point. This helped me lot
This feel bad about had before because now can see worth it. material up code recommended Android code style from material so much thorough than other Android learning resources I've Not only do get explanations example lecture videos themselves do job explaining concepts at high level before get into code. found lecture videos gave me so many where whole picture easier only grading 100% quizzes. don't find these particularly engaging, prefer completing assignments must pass etc. I'm still giving 5 stars because didn't from my experience. I'm pretty so just made my own challenges didn't move until able code examples what we learned each specialization without doubt first thing I'd point someone who interest learning Android
This has set me free from my my ideas writing.
been reading about little has shown me bit great most human between where each one doubt also great importance between also been by introduction great our our multiple access around am also grateful introduction meditation great Coursera course, thanks all those made available so many
instructor kept different as if she wasn't sure what she saying She just reading off actually teaching. been bit just read well prepared set slides my first set quiz questions also weren't really relevant what actual Quite disappointed part specialization as other sections had depth clear information, lots examples great
pretty emphasis too much using tools proper coding required code we as learners only asked make few changes already code.
Excellent beginners .
teacher just awesome! love Thanks alot making available everyone really appreciate it!
This one most useful my been long time Buddhist found difficult both my own practice through understanding This provided much background wanted long time. am particularly interested discussion Buddhist as practice, content various practices one lectures incredibly information learned them as well as listen Now out particularly appreciate many lectures, interviews guided meditation my questions yet some understanding ideas

easy understand. Excellent introductory cancer general.
Great course!
This class lot statistical knowledge background covered first three classes So much statistical used by instructor, felt like taking class another language where had video she It took lot finish class, which overall experience.
finished first This an amazing To review why (and programming assignments, from easy many other courses, multiple programming You choices C They may add Super learners come here share knowledge lot. There were so many times I'm my algorithm can't then another came another instructor, Mr. super nice he made forum first learners time use. You no choice all 3 aspects has However, both quality well worth You can read other many agree this.

For people who want world
really like It algorithms which learned my going further approach examples given good. feel if real time examples provided will students understand where they can apply these algorithms or they can implement their own algorithms.
series slides down explanations introductory algorithmic concepts, followed up programming assignments. slides course, as presenters from points learned lot during gain your knowledge, will require out additional materials your learning. being an introductory course, presenters when setting presenters often over fairly complex concepts, them as they were knowledge. This mathematical where most steps without context their or points used place what could detailed material left than providing explanations don't need go into detail this, only concept from important what we want focus on. book presenters would read mathematical from slides move on. often how much would need know about such terms presenters don't up many I'm etc. as these often professional rather than professional But quality online education definitely one. now expect nothing less than presenters exceptional most videos presenters read from slides their hands explain concepts would better down from times presenters go into depth get I've come expect when complex concepts from master like or After couple weeks into course, just went straight read Introduction most all things as my focus through introductory concepts, where out.
completed must say one best courses taken because clear all information. In addition, development projects allow learn deep way.
instructor informative, material just excellent!
Awesome lectures portion great. really helps understanding how use online tools resources.
All theory. were left questions based models never seen or explained spent most time trying make sense them. project almost try how create from based ones they provided quizzes. Its difficult when actual excel model making part lectures.
